# Roblox 2016 Texture Pack
This pack includes some of the 2016 textures and icons.<br>
To download: Click the green 'Code' button and then click 'Download as ZIP'<br>
Keep in mind, you should set it up manually. The original one had a virus, so I decided to make a fork of it and remove malware.<br>
Don't use UNUSED folder by the way!<br>
