# Roblox 2016 Texture Pack
This pack includes some of the 2016 through mid 2019 icons.<br>
To download: Click the green 'Code' button and then click 'Download as ZIP'<br>
Keep in mind, you should set it up manually. The original one had a virus, so I decided to make a fork of it and remove malware.<br>

# Manual Setup
Right click on your Roblox Launcher Shortcut.<br>

What you would need to do next is open the file location, where you will be greeted with a couple of folders.<br>
<br>

Open the "content folder" and now do the following.<br>
Make sure you have downloaded the texture pack, otherwise it will NOT work!<br>
<br>
1. Drag the sounds folder from downloaded texture pack to the Roblox content folder.<br>
- if a notification box pops up, replace all.<br>
<br>
2. Go inside textures folder, which appears inside of Roblox content folder.<br>
<br>
3. If you got the path correct, you should be able to see a lot of these folders.<br>

<br>
We will be mainly focusing on "Cursors" folder, but then "ui" folder.<br>
<br>
4. If you have found yourself inside the Cursors folder, open the "Cursor" folder inside the textures pack and drag all of these images into "KeyboardMouse" folder. Once done, you must replace all of the following files, once the notification box pops up.<br>
<br>
5. Go to the "ui" folder and drag "common" and "PlayerList" from the pack to the "ui" folder. Replace all, and you are good to go!<br>
<br>
# NOTICE!
This works on all versions of Roblox, by the way.
